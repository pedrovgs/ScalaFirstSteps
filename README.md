FIRST STEPS WITH SCALA
======================

Scala is an object-functional programming and scripting language for general software applications, statically typed, designed to concisely express solutions in an elegant, type-safe and lightweight (low ceremonial) manner. Scala has full support for functional programming (including currying, pattern matching, algebraic data types, lazy evaluation, tail recursion, immutability, etc.). It cleans up what are often considered poor design decisions in Java (such as type erasure, checked exceptions, the non-unified type system) and adds a number of other features designed to allow cleaner, more concise and more expressive code to be written.

This repository contains some samples written in Scala to evaluate some of the most important concepts of this language. This samples review this concepts:

* Hello world.
* Scala interacting with Java code.
* Everything is an object in Scala.
* Anonymous functions.
* Classes.
* Override methods.
* Simple pattern machine.
* Pattern machine.
* Traits.
* Traits with "with" sintax.
* Generics.
* Types.
* Partial applications.
* Apply methods.
* Objects.
* Case classes.
* Collections.
* Functional Combinators.
* Tail Recursion.
* Functional Composition.
* Thread and Runnable.
* Strings.
* Implicit Classes.
* Numbers.
